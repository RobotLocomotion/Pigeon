Unfortunately, the process of adding textures to the CAD files is far from straightforward. After adding textures in Solidworks, I found that you cannot actually
export them to any other program, making that whole process a waste of time. Instead, I did what I describe below, though I'm sure there has to be a better way.

1) Export URDF as described in other document

2) Use convert_stl_dae.sh script to create untextured COLLADA (.dae) files

3) In Trimble Sketchup (previously Google Sketchup)
    a) Import the COLLADA files just generated into Sketchup
    b) Fix any holes in the mesh if you notice them using the "Line Tool" to retrace lines in the mesh, forcing the program to redraw faces between them.
      The process of exporting to .dae files before bringing them into Solidworks minimized the number of these holes, as the Sketchup STL import feature
      is very buggy and only captures about 50% of the faces.
    c) Import the image file you wish to use as a texture to Sketchup, and position it as you would want to project it onto the mesh.
    d) Right click and "explode" both of the components (the mesh and the image)
    e) Select the "Paint bucket" tool, and hold down "Alt" while clicking on the image
    f) Hold down "Ctrl" and click on the mesh, the texture should apply.
    g) Export the model as a COLLADA (.dae) file again. It will now have textures

4) Run through Pat Marion's script to get the files into a format that drake can work with (I actually don't know what his script does, I just know it works)
