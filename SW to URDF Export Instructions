Steps for exporting URDF from Solidworks

1) Create model and make sure all mates in Solidworks are configured as you wish the robot to move
2) Export the URDF
    - File > Export to URDF
    - Click start at the base_link and begin to build up the URDF tree, making sure to name links and joints as you go
    - N.B. If there is already URDF data in the file, delete it from the Solidworks FeatureManager Design Tree (it will be all the items at the bottom of the list)
           even though the program claims to be able to use a preconfigured file to update it, I've found this feature doesn't work very well, and it's easier to
           just start from scratch each time
    - As you go through making the tree, make sure you specify all of the fields (don't leave any as "Automatically generate," it almost always does it wrong)
3) Open the URDF
4) Simplify all "ghost" links to the form:

  <link
    name="whatever_the_name_is_ghost">
    <inertial>
       <mass
        value="0" />
    </inertial>
  </link>

5) Remove all <collision> </collision> blocks
6) Find and replace all instances of "package://whatever_the_urdf_is_named" with ".."
7) Go to the "meshes" folder within the URDF directory, copy the "convert_dae_2_wrl_obj_stl_chullobj.sh" file into this folder from one of the previous pigeon models
   While in this folder, delete all the ghost .stl files
   Run the converter script file you just copied from the terminal. Now there should be both stl and obj files in the folder
8) add damping to the joints as well as any springs, airfoils, etc.
