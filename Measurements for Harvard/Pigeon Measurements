First off, we'd like to hear if you think the attached model looks overall correct, especially with regards to joint placement, etc.
    We currently have both the shoulder and elbow implemented as ball and socket joints, with the wrist being a single pin-joint. Does that sound right?

Dimensions (see attached PDF)
  A = 
  B = 
  C = 
  D = 
  E = 
  F = 
  G = 
  H = 
  I = 
  J = 
  K = 
  L = 
  M = 


Mass (we got these from the paper you sent us, we just want to make sure everything looks correct):
  Torso+Head  =   266.60  g
  Tail        =   2.83  	g
  Upper Wing  = 	4.78  	g
  Mid Wing		=   9.23   	g
  Hand Wing		=   6.06   	g


We were also wondering about what sorts of data you might have (if any) on the tendons/ligaments.
    We're trying to figure out what spring/damping coefficients make sense for the joints


Also, as I mentioned in my email, some good photographs of the birds (especially a top-view, but side and front if possible) would really help a lot.
    At present we're mostly relying on pictures we found online to estimate the wing shapes, so we'd rather get a good one from you to work off of.
